  utter_external_examiners:
    - text: "In the UK Higher Education system, Universities are responsible for the academic standards of the awards that they offer, and for the quality of the education they provide to enable students to meet those standards. The role of the external examiner is an essential part of the University’s quality assurance processes. They essentially externally ‘audit’ the programmes that they are appointed to, in terms of the attainment of academic standards and the quality of the education. The University of Hertfordshire appoints external examiners mainly from other Universities, but also from industry and/or the professions. They are qualified and experienced in the subject, have an understanding of the academic standards required for the award and are also independent of the University of Hertfordshire. As such, they are able to provide carefully considered advice on the academic standards of the programmes and/or modules to which they have been appointed, and can offer advice on good practice and how to enhance the quality of those programmes/modules. They are also able to offer an informed view of how standards compare with the same or similar awards at other UK Universities of which they have experience. It is important to note that whilst external examiners are full members of the Boards of Examiners to which they are appointed, the decisions of the Board are the collective, consensus views of all members of the Board. Another important feature of external examining in the UK is the provision of annual written reports to the University, based on what they have observed of the institution's assessment processes and the sample of student work that they have seen. These reports provide invaluable independent feedback to the University at module and/or programme level. The University of Hertfordshire recognises the importance of the role of students in the management of academic standards and quality. External examiners' reports are therefore made available to student representatives, as part of the programme monitoring process. If you are not a student representative and would like to request a copy of the External Examiners’ reports relating to your programme, then please email aqo@herts.ac.uk(mailto:aqoherts.ac.uk), stating your ID number, the full title of your programme and your current year/level. A list of external examiners, by subject area, is also available via aqo@herts.ac.uk(mailto:aqoherts.ac.uk). Please note that contacting external examiners regarding any aspect of your programme of study is prohibited. The University has appropriate internal mechanisms in place if you wish to raise a concern using the complaints or appeals procedures, as appropriate (links below): Student complaints procedure(https://ask.herts.ac.uk/making-a-complaint) Student appeals procedure(https://ask.herts.ac.uk/academic-appeals-requests-for-the-review-of-assessment-decisions)."

  utter_artificial_intelligence_ai_tools:
    - text: "Information about the University's policy on the use of artificial intelligence tools. Artificial intelligence tools (AI) have had lots of coverage in the news recently including how they can be used in workplaces and universities. You may have heard of tools such as Chat GPT, DALLE-2, Co-Pilot, and Google Bard although there are many more available for different purposes. When it comes to your course, inappropriate use of these tools can negatively impact your learning as well as affecting your own confidence in your qualification and ability. While such tools may seem like time-savers, their potential and limitations are still not fully explored. So far, we know that some materials/information may be out of date or incorrect, and some of the information may be fictitious or contain false references and quotes. We're also aware that since AI models are trained on the data that they are exposed to, this can result in biases. So, responses or information you pull out of such tools may reflect these biases and demonstrate discriminatory attitudes and beliefs."
  
  utter_our_stance_on_ai_tools:
    - text: "The University’s academic integrity policy (UPR AS14 Appendix III) sets out our stance on plagiarism including fake referencing which can often be the case with AI tools. Therefore, it is crucial that you do not use AI tools to generate an assessment and submit it as your own work; to do so will constitute academic misconduct."
  
  utter_when_to_use_ai_tool:
    - text: "The only occasions where you may use AI tools in your assessment is if you have explicit permission from your tutor in your assessment brief. Your assessment brief will include information on how to declare any use of such tools, and you can speak to your tutor for guidance. If you do not reference your use, then this will constitute academic misconduct. Our current University policy on academic misconduct adequately covers the misuse of such tools, but we are updating them to be clearer on the matter. Unauthorised use of artificially generated material (AI) in researching or presenting material for an assessment is an academic misconduct offence if you use AI tools in producing your assessment unless the use of AI tools is expressly permitted. However, even if expressly permitted, where you do not declare that you have used an artificial intelligence tool(s) in the production of your assessment, or you are dishonest about the extent to which such tools have been used, you will have committed academic misconduct."

  utter_future_of_ai_tools:
    - text: "As the world of AI tools develops, Herts will continue to discuss its potential and limitations and review our policies. The University’s Graduate Attributes expect our students to be ethical and evidence-based in their work, and therefore any future permitted use will be in line with our academic integrity principles set out above. If you have questions about how this might affect your assessments, please speak to your module leader, programme leader or personal tutor."
